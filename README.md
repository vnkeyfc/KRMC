# Key RAW Manga Collection (KRMC)

This is a RAW manga collection adapted from Visual Arts/Key's works and some related works. Additionally, this package includes some novels (which may or may not be rare) derived from Key's works. All RAW versions are of high quality, sourced from digital sources or manually scanned. If you want to contribute a higher quality RAW version or wish to add other manga, please contact Vietnam Key FanClub through the Issues tab.

The collection serves as a 'manga bank' solely for the purpose of facilitating the translation of Key's manga into multiple languages. Please do not use the RAW versions for commercial purposes or any other activities that infringe on copyright.
